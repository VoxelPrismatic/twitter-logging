# This bot
A mostly self contained discord bot which can log Twitter accounts into any channel.

I can seriously argue this is the best Twitter logging bot in all of Discord, as it doesn't simply
repost links and hope for the best. This tracks threads, so when tweets are deleted, you can fetch it
from the depths of the internet.

## Features
- Saves video
  - Note: This does take up storage space on your device. Please have a folder called `tw-cache` in the same directory as this bot.
- Saves images
  - Note: This does NOT take up local storage, this is caching straight from twitter.
- Thread interpreting
  - Gives context up to 5 tweets in history
- Displays poll options
- Send links in specified channels to log specific tweets
- Thumbnails provide previews to the image from the previous tweet
- Links reveal the URL, so you know what you're clicking on.
- `@accounts`, `#hashtags` and whatever `$cashtags` are all produce valid links
- Easy to read and understand

## Notes
This bot is intended for live feeds, so it will not display likes, comments, retweets or poll statistics.

While you can send specific links to save them, it uses the same underlying system to log tweets and will not display those statistics.

It is a trade-off you must be willing to make when using this bot.
